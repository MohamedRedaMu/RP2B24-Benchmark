ðŸš€ **Reda Path Planning Benchmark Library 2024 (RP2B24)** - A standardized collection of 50 diverse path-planning scenarios designed for benchmarking path-planning algorithms.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This benchmark library provides:
- A diverse set of 50 path-planning problems with varying obstacle distributions.
- Compatibility with optimization-based and machine-learning-based path planners.
- Standardized test cases for **fair comparisons** in autonomous driving research.
